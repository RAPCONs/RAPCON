# RAPCON

**Radar Approach Control Facility (RAPCON)**

Is a facility based in an airport terminal that uses both non-radar and radar to provide services for planes that are moving through a controlled airspace, landing, or taking off. RAPCONs commonly operate near civil and military airports and may be controlled by the FAA, military or both.

## Project discription:

**Up for discussion**
The MVP of this project is:

1. access a flight tracking API that:
    - Creates an object out of flight data
    - Shows data about individual flights
    - Shows data about flights comming out/into a chosen airport.

2. Allows a user to subscribe to flight information:
    - When a flight departs
    - Tracks its status...
        - departure time;
        - ETA;
        - Ground speed
    - When a flight lands.

3. Show data about a given aircraft:
    - SQUAWK ID
    - Departing airport
    - Destination airport
    - Next destination

**Stretch Goals**

> Create a bot that tracks random aircraft and pushes its relevent data
> Create this app to support SMS texts to our users. (E.g. Send a text to Ryan about when his mother's flight arrives from ATL to SEA)
